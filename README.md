# Machine Learning & Data Science - Learning Journey

## Description
This repository documents my comprehensive learning journey through core Machine Learning and Data Science libraries. It includes hands-on projects, practical exercises, and real-world datasets to reinforce foundational concepts and build practical skills. The content is structured to help both beginners and developers deepen their understanding of data science and machine learning workflows.

## What You'll Learn

### Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib — *EDA & Data Analysis*

This section covers the essentials of data handling and exploration:

- **NumPy**: Master the basics of numerical computing using arrays, broadcasting, and vectorized operations.
- **Pandas**: Learn to manipulate structured data, clean datasets, and perform group operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualize data effectively using plots, bar charts, histograms, and more.

*Goal*: Develop strong data wrangling and visualization skills to prepare data for machine learning.

---

### Scikit-Learn — *Modelling & Machine Learning*

Dive into supervised learning using **Scikit-Learn**, one of the most popular ML libraries in Python.

- Model training & evaluation
- Classification, regression
- Model validation using cross-validation and metrics like accuracy, MAE, RMSE

*Goal*: Learn to build, train, and test models efficiently with clean code and real-world datasets.

## Projects I Built While Learning

### [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/DCode-v05/Heart-Disease-Classification)

A classification problem where we predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on features like age, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type.

Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn  
Goal: Improve healthcare insights using logistic regression & SVM models.

---

### [Blue Book for Bulldozer Price Prediction](https://github.com/DCode-v05/Bulldozer-Price-Prediction)

A regression problem to predict the sale price of bulldozers using temporal and categorical features.

Tools: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, RandomForestRegressor  
Goal: Learn about feature engineering and model optimization in regression problems.

---

### [Dog Breed Classification](https://github.com/DCode-v05/Dog-Breed-Classification)

A computer vision problem where we classify images of dogs into their respective breeds using a Convolutional Neural Network.

Tools: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV  
Goal: Learn the basics of image classification and deep learning.
