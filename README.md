# 🧠 Machine Learning & Data Science Journey 🚀  
[🔗 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Denistanb/ML-DS)

Welcome to my personal repository where I documented my **learning journey through core Machine Learning and Data Science libraries**. Along the way, I also built some exciting real-world projects to apply what I learned.

This repository is ideal for:
- Beginners who want a hands-on introduction to ML libraries
- Developers exploring practical data science applications
- Anyone looking to reinforce foundational concepts

## 📘 What You'll Learn

### 🔍 Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib — *EDA & Data Analysis*

This section covers the essentials of data handling and exploration:

- **NumPy**: Master the basics of numerical computing using arrays, broadcasting, and vectorized operations.
- **Pandas**: Learn to manipulate structured data, clean datasets, and perform group operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualize data effectively using plots, bar charts, histograms, and more.

📌 *Goal*: Develop strong data wrangling and visualization skills to prepare data for machine learning.

---

### 🤖 Scikit-Learn — *Modelling & Machine Learning*

Dive into supervised learning using **Scikit-Learn**, one of the most popular ML libraries in Python.

- Model training & evaluation
- Classification, regression
- Model validation using cross-validation and metrics like accuracy, MAE, RMSE

📌 *Goal*: Learn to build, train, and test models efficiently with clean code and real-world datasets.

## 🧪 Projects I Built While Learning

### 🔗 [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/Denistanb/ML-DS/tree/main/Projects/Heart%20Disease%20Prediction)

A classification problem where we predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on features like age, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type.

🛠 Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn  
🎯 Goal: Improve healthcare insights using logistic regression & SVM models.

---

### 🔗 [Blue Book for Bulldozer Price Prediction](https://github.com/Denistanb/ML-DS/tree/main/Projects/Blue%20Book%20for%20Bulldozers)

A regression problem to predict the sale price of bulldozers using temporal and categorical features.

🛠 Tools: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, RandomForestRegressor  
🎯 Goal: Learn about feature engineering and model optimization in regression problems.

---

### 🔗 [Dog Breed Classification](https://github.com/Denistanb/ML-DS/tree/main/Projects/Dog%20Breed%20Classification)

A computer vision problem where we classify images of dogs into their respective breeds using a Convolutional Neural Network.

🛠 Tools: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV  
🎯 Goal: Learn the basics of image classification and deep learning.
